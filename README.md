# Colis Management and Real-Time Tracking Application
This is a web application for parcel management and real-time tracking that I developed during my end-of-study internship at Bee Coders. The project was built using Angular, and it provided me with the opportunity to learn many aspects of front-end developmen. The backend is [here](https://github.com/mokhtar85/Application-web-de-gestion-et-de-suivi-de-colis-de-transport-partie-back)
